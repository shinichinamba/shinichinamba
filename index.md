I am an assistant professor at Department of Genome Informatics, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Japan (Prof. Yukinori Okada). 
My research focuses on human genetics. 
In particular, I am interested in elucidating the genetic structure of complex traits, disease risk prediction, and drug discovery.
Before completing Ph.D. at Osaka University (Prof. Yukinori Okada), I studied transcriptome and methylome in cancer under Professors Hiroyuki Mano and Masahito Kawazu at the University of Tokyo.
