I am a Ph.D. candidate supervised by Prof. Yukinori Okada at Department of Statistical Genetics, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan. 
My research focuses on human genetics. 
In particular, I am interested in elucidating the genetic structure of complex traits, disease risk prediction, and drug discovery.
Before entering the Ph.D. program, I studied transcriptome and methylome in cancer under Professors Hiroyuki Mano and Masahito Kawazu at the University of Tokyo.
